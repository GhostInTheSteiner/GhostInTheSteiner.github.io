### Phase 13.4
#### “The part of my soul that's left...”

<div class="story-chapter-text">

Yet again, the both of us were surrounded by silence.

The roller shutters remained closed ever since I came, leaving us with what little light the old bulbs of this hall gave off. Certainly—this was a rare sight...

For the most part, it was only during harsh weather conditions like storms or last year's typhoon that we kept the hangar entrance closed off. In those times we used the small door in the back that also Akiho headed for as she left.

As I was staring on the shutters, I heard distant screams from the outside. Listening in, I could make out a kid's voice, full of enthusiasm...

<div class="text-quoted">“There...! They're trying to get him up!”</div>

At the same time, an engine was turned on. Someone started shouting a series of commands after which I heard a loud rattling sound—likely of an iron chain.

<div class="text-quoted">“I'm soooo hyped...! Go Gunvarrel, go...!”</div>

The rattling sound suddenly stopped, as if the chain abruptly tightened. Right after, a loud roaring began to fill the room. Even the ground was shaking...

<div class="text-quoted">“Look, it's huuuuuge...!”</div>

Doc was out there... Could this be his doing? After all, he really *did* take a likening to GunBuild-1.

Then...

Perhaps it was the contrast to the kids' enthusiasm, perhaps the long silence. But I reflexively winced upon hearing that soft whisper:

<div class="text-quoted">“...it matters not how strait the gate, —”</div>

Lyrical, almost poetic in language.

<div class="text-quoted">“—how charged with punishments the scroll, —”</div>

Misa-nee's words—as strange as they were—seemed oddly familiar to me. I felt like I heard them once before... Perhaps in some kind of book, or some sort of poem.

<div class="text-quoted">“Woah...! This needs to be Tanegashima's icon...! Let's place him somewhere everyone can see him...!”</div>

Somewhere outside, a thrilled kid's voice declared Super GunBuild-1 to the island's new landmark.

<div class="text-quoted">“...back then, with that decision. Whether imposed upon or grown inside...”</div>

A reminiscent look in her eyes, still using that distant tone... Misa-nee continued with her enigmatic choice of words. Unaware of this, the increasingly excited screams only kept going stronger.

<div class="text-quoted">“This is incredible...! Gunvarrel is real...!”</div>

Countless voices, filled with joy and happiness. Innumerable hopes, shared by young and old. Myriads of dreams, fulfilled just now, on this very day. And the very reason for it all...

<div class="text-quoted">“...indeed.”</div>

Right here. Right in front of me. As if replying to them...

<div class="text-quoted">“...back then, with that decision. Despite the reason, despite the cause...”</div>

Misa-nee went on. Her eyes still cloudy, her gaze a blank stare resting on some part of the ceiling.

<div class="text-quoted">“...I might have truly been... The master of my fate.”</div>

Right after... a piercingly loud screeching noise broke the silence. Seemingly omnipresent, it echoed throughout the entire hangar. It wasn't before a few seconds passed that I realized the roller shutters began to open. The bright daylight made me lose my sight for a moment.

<div class="story-image"><img src="images/hangar.png"></div>

<div class="text-quoted">“...what little I could do, ...”</div>

After reflexively closing my eyes, Misa-nee's fading voice resounded somewhere in my head. While I couldn't see what happened, I didn't miss the sudden presence of several persons. Rapidly moving feets, precisely spoken orders... Out of nowhere, all of this seemed to surround the both of us.

<div class="text-quoted">“...what little of myself I kept, ...”</div>

Misa-nee's whisper nearly drowned in the noise, causing me to almost miss her words. Upon hearing her voice, I tried to open my eyes again.

<div class="text-italic">Just what was she trying to get at...?</div>

Right in front of me, I could make out the shapes of three man. Standing next to Misa-nee's frail limbs they began to lift up her body, aiming for a stretcher right beside her. 

Apparently the paramedics arrived. In an instant, Misa-nee was fixated on the stretcher and picked up from the ground. And just then—

<div class="text-quoted">“...the part of my soul that's left, ...”</div>

As the paramedics began to carry her out of the hangar, right before leaving me behind—I could hear her feeble voice one last time.

And despite the short moment she remained in my ears reach. Despite her cryptic words turning into a fading whisper. The final words she spoke, shaping the last pieces of her enigmatic past. I clearly understood them all.

My eyes kept following her. Through the hangar's enormous gates, right out into a giant crowd of people. One that kept on laughing, and kept on cheering.

And amongst it... countless children, gazing up to the crystallization of our blood and tears. Overwhelmed by the manifestation of our hopes and dreams. Even Doc, who stood right next to his crane, carried a warm smile on his face.

And all of that... due to her.

<div class="text-quoted">“Hey, Misa-nee...”</div>

Just like before, as I entered the hangar. I tried to find the right words for my feelings.

<div class="text-quoted">“All those people... No matter if girl or boy, no matter if young or old.”</div>

The young kids cheering up to GunBuild, as well the old geezers gazing up to it in awe. The people who kept helping to shape Super GunBuild-1, as well as the spectators from afar.

<div class="text-quoted">“They still have a place to go home to. What more could they possibly want?”</div>

I watched as Misa-nee was taken through the crowd. As she crossed GunBuild-1's giant body, someone amongst the mass of people caught my eye. Standing apart from the others, right next to two men with notepads in their hands—was a girl, that couldn't avert her gaze. All the while staring at the group of persons hurriedly pacing through the crowd. Or more precisely... at the very person in-between.

Akiho, apparently interviewed by policemen, seemed as if she wanted to turn around and sprint right off to her sister. Her mouth opened, probably shouting out. Perhaps in a desperate attempt to leave one last message, or to send out one final goodbye...

Then, as if to reply... 

<div class="story-image story-image-small"><img src="images/RN22_355e.PNG"></div>

High up in the sky, the sun came out from beneath the orange-colored clouds. Bathed by its golden shades of light, Super GunBuild-1's posture almost felt reminiscent of an heroic warrior. An exhausted veteran, marked by a deep scar running from his shoulder down to his waist.

And just in this moment, right before Misa-nee was taken into the ambulance. Whether it were Akiho's words that reached her, or GunBuild's image that affected her. For some reason—a wistful smile appeared on her libs, and a peaceful expression formed on her face.

<div class="text-italic">“...back then, with that decision.”</div>

I watched as the ambulance doors were being closed. As I just stood there—unable to move an inch—her words from right now kept echoing through my mind.

<div class="text-italic">“...I might have truly been... The master of my fate.”</div>

Headlights flickered on, an engine started roaring. The ambulance's wheels slowly began turning, causing the vehicle to start moving down the runway. Gradually increasing in speed its shape became smaller by the second.

<div class="text-quoted">“Still, Misa-nee...”</div>

One last time, I directed my voice at her.

<div class="text-quoted">“After all this... were you also the captain of your soul?”</div>

Taking the exit lane at the end of the runway, the ambulance soon disappeared into the distance. Headed straight for Minamitane, that was home to the General Tanegashima Hospital. I could still see the red flashing lights for a while before I lost them amongst the trees of a nearby forest.

Then...

Perhaps it was after an eternity. Long after I lost sight of the ambulance, as soon as I collected my thoughts.

I headed out.

Leaving this old and abandoned hangar behind. Setting out into the twilight, with a certain destination in mind—and a clear goal ahead.

<div class="text-italic">“...the part of my soul that's left, ...”</div>

What she had left me with. The very last bit of Misa-nee's self. A missing piece, eventually completing the strange puzzle of her mysterious past.

<div class="text-quoted">“Kaiiiiiii...!”</div>

Somewhere in the distance, I heard Akiho's desperate scream as I sprinted off to my scooter. I felt bad for leaving her behind with the police, but right now none of that mattered. Because...

Whatever reason it was that caused 'your' life to sway. The undisclosed secret that woke 'your' desires, and that sudden spark that bore 'your' dreams. An event that thoroughly changed what 'your' life has been up until then, for the longest time.

<div class="text-italic">I was finally about to find out.<br>
...and I would certainly fulfill your request, Misa-nee.</div>
