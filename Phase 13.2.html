<h4 id="of-course-were-meant-to-you">“Of course we're meant to you...!”</h4>
<div class="story-chapter-text">
<div class="text-quoted">“Big Sis...! You're awake...!”</div>
<p>Upon hearing her sister's voice, Akiho immediately bursted into tears... Tears of joy, obviously.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“Are you fine...?! Do you remember what happened...?! We erased Kimijima Kou...!”</div>
<p>As she wiped the tears from her eyes, her face became strangely excited. For seven long years the feelings inside of her were unable to find their way. Instead, they must only have kept boiling up.</p>
<p>That's why... in this very moment, with their goal right in front—they finally broke free.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“You've seen Super GunBuild-1, right? I know, we made lots of changes to your initial design, but at its core it's still the same... Besides, did you read my messages? I sent you a picture of GunBuild-1...”</div>
<p>That's right. Back then, during last year's summer... as we completed Misa-nee's robot for the very first time. Akiho's enthusiasm kept going strong as she was eagerly awaiting the day of our first test run. Upon sending out her message, she was certainly hoping for a reply.</p>
<p>After all—the unwavering ambitions she harboured, and the incredible efforts she made. All of them sparked from a single person. A person, who seemed entirely out of reach at the time.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“It's true that we had a bad start, but we improved it. The Robotics Club found a lot of new members and backing by Space Candy, too... In the end, we even got JAXA's support, can you imagine...? GunBuild-1 had to be put on hold, but—”</div>
<div class="text-quoted">“...Aki.”</div>
<p>A faint whisper cut her off, putting an end to Akiho's mindless anecdote about GunBuild-1. The increasing excitement on her face suddenly vanished, then slowly became replaced by an expression of growing anxiety.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...no matter... what you do...”</div>
<p>Seemingly struggling to keep talking, and still caught up by the numbness from her comatose state.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...even... after all this...”</div>
<p>Misa-nee's voice was stumbling, her libs visibly trembling as she spoke. It became obvious just how much strength uttering those words required.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...even... after all this. No matter... what you do...”</div>
<p>Stabbing words, that felt strangely familiar. As if conjuring the past, they seemed to wake old demons from seven years ago. Caught by their inevitable spell, what should finally leave Misa-nee's mouth was—</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...average.”</div>
<p>Upon hearing that word, Akiho let out an audible gasp...</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...you've only... ever been average.”</div>
<p>Struck speechless, both of us stared into Misa-nee's eyes. Absolute disbelief painted on our faces.</p>
<div class="text-italic">Just like back then...</div>
<p>Of course, Akiho told me. About what happened on the day her sister left for Tokyo. Ever since then I knew—I knew, just what caused that huge sister complex of hers. And what fuelled her desire to finish GunBuild-1 more than anything.</p>
<p>That's why, staring down on Misa-nee, both of us were at a loss for words. Compared to before her breathing became a lot heavier, and its pace a lot faster. However, her strained face began to soften... and the black look disappeared from her eyes.</p>
<div class="text-quoted-inline">“...even so."</div>, Misa-nee softly whispered. As she continued to speak, another expression formed on her face.
<div class="text-quoted">“...do you think I saw this coming... almost ten years ago?”</div>
<div class="text-italic">Was that... a smile?</div>
<p>Once again, we didn't know what to say. It felt like we just sat there for an eternity. Dumbfounded. Still staring down on Misa-nee.</p>
<p>The one to finally break the silence was—</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...Big Sis.”</div>
<p>I wasn't able to tell whether Akiho's voice carried relief, or if she was still stuck in a state of shock. Not that I was sure about my own feelings right now...</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...Big Sis. Thank you...”</div>
<p>Akiho whispered softly, while tightening the grip on Misa-nee's right hand she was still holding.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...thank you... so much...”</div>
<p>Tears started to roll over her cheeks, dropping down on her long-lost sister's face.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...I love you, Big Sis.”</div>
<p>Right now... whatever it was that she chased after. Perhaps just a single word of appreciation, or a hint of praise. She might finally have found it.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...back then. On that one day.”</div>
<p>Misa-nee suddenly began recounting on her past. Contrary to her firm voice of just moments ago, she now seemed a lot more feeble, her voice almost devoid of emotion.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...the day of the solar eclipse. When it all began...”</div>
<div class="text-italic">'...the day of the solar eclipse'?</div>
<p>Thinking about it, I remembered the omnipresent anticipation around those eclipses. Everyone on the island was on their feet: People who left their workplaces mid-day, teachers who joined their students outside, eagerly waiting both alike. On those days we always got a lesson cancelled so we could witness them with our own eyes. Interestingly enough—even though those events were big deals—I don't think I've ever seen Misa-nee around.</p>
<p>Looking back down on her, I realized her eyes began to turn cloudy. It felt like her mind was somewhere else—far, far away from this place...</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...as I set them into stone. Was it faith that shaped my dreams...? Or were it dreams that shaped my faith...?”</div>
<p>Deep inside of me. Somewhere between 'his' words and Misa-nee's actions. Something unsettling began to sprout.</p>
<div class="text-quoted-inline">“Misa-nee... that..."</div>>, I began to voice my thoughts. However, I was cut off before I even started.
<div class="text-quoted">“...the people I met. Have they been written into my life...? Or were they meant for me...?”</div>
<p>Misa-nee went on to say something almost as cryptic. Seeing her like that, I wondered if she was still aware of her surroundings. It seemed like she entered some sort of fever dream.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“'Written into'... Are you saying—”</div>
<p>I started another attempt at putting my thoughts into words. This time, it was Akiho who interrupted.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“What do you mean...? Of course we're meant to you...!”</div>
<p>It seems like she didn't take her sister's words too well. Indeed, I can easily imagine how that was the very last thing she wanted to hear from Misa-nee right now.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“Hey, Misa-nee. Is this about... 'him'?”</div>
<p>I could no longer hold back the thoughts that began to spread on the back of my mind.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“Is this about... *Kimijima Kou*?”</div>
<p>Upon hearing that name, a hard to judge expression appeared on Misa-nee's face. For some time after, we were engulfed by silence.</p>
<p>Then... a mere two words left her mouth.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...Friendship. Love.”</div>
<p>Her feeble voice seemed wistful as she spoke, yet I didn't miss that subtle hint of bitterness. As if remembering something painful, resting on her mind ever since.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...Aki, Kai. Have you ever been blessed by any of it?”</div>
<p>As I heard that... I felt a lump forming somewhere deep inside my throat. Being asked by Misa-nee of all people—it brought back feelings, that seven years ago would have been simple to judge. Yet feelings, that seven years later might have morphed, that might have diverged...</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...it really *does* feel like someone was meant to you... doesn't it?”</div>
<p>It wasn't up until then that I realized. My eyes... They were no longer resting on Misa-nee's. Instead, the two eyes looking back at me. Right now, in this very moment.</p>
<p>Those eyes... were Akiho's eyes.</p>
