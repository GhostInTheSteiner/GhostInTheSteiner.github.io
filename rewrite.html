        <div class="text-quoted">“...Aki.”</div>
<p>A faint whisper cut her off, putting an end to Akiho's mindless anecdote about GunBuild-1. The increasing excitement on her face vanished, and became replaced by an expression of growing anxiety.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...no matter... what you do...”</div>
<p>Still caught up by the numbness from her comatose state, she was clearly struggling to keep talking.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...even... after all this...”</div>
<p>Misa-nee's voice was stumbling, her libs visibly trembling as she spoke. It became obvious just how much strength uttering those words required. Words—that felt strangely familiar. As if triggered by them, memories from seven years ago resurfaced—and reaffirmed a trait that seemed long forgotten.</p>
<p>What should finally leave Misa-nee's mouth was—</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...average.”</div>
<p>Akiho let out an audible gasp.</p>
<div class="text-quoted">“...you've only... ever been average.”</div>
<p>Struck speechless, both of us stared into Misa-nee's eyes. Absolute disbelief painted on our faces.</p>
