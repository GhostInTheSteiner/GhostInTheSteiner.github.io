## 「 Heliosheath Transmitter 」
### Phase 13.3
#### “Sometimes... ignorance is bliss.”

<div class="story-chapter-text">

The old airport's runway. A chilly morning wind was blowing over the terrain, causing trees and blades of grass to move along to its gentle gusts. Just moments before sunrise me and Akiho were out there, a new day dawning right over the horizon.

<div class="text-quoted">“Oh, and... think I can get a blessing from the goddess of victory? You know, like... a kiss?”</div>

Upon hearing my request, it felt like Akiho was lost in thought... Like she heard the words, but hasn't realized their meaning yet.

<span class="text-quoted-inline">“Aki-chan?”</span>, I asked, in an effort to bring her back to reality.

<div class="text-quoted">“Oh, ah! With me...? Are you sure...?”</div>

Obviously flustered, her tone suddenly became unsteady. Avoiding my gaze her eyes began to dart around the runway...

<div class="text-quoted">“Wouldn't you... rather have one... from Big Sis...?”</div>

In a weak attempt at evading my question, her stumbling voice increased even more. It became clear just how much my sudden demand must have caught her off-guard.

Yet, that's exactly why...

<div class="text-quoted">“It has to be you, Aki-chan.”</div>

I confirmed it once again—purging doubt from my words, and pressuring for an answer. Eventually driving Akiho into a corner, leaving not a single way out. Thus, as a result...

<div class="story-image"><img src="images/EV_AKI022A.PNG"></div>

She gave up.

Ultimately giving in to the words she heard, and accepting the feelings she held. Just this once, for the very first time in our lifes—our unspoken desires should meet each other.

<div class="story-divider story-divider-custommargin1"></div>

<div class="text-italic-quoted text-nomargintop">“Have you ever been blessed by any of it?”</div>

Certainly, I kept playing it cool. Casual enough that it felt like our usual chitchat, yet careful enough to not let her get a read on me. Eventually following the unfortunate patterns Kill-Ballad brought upon me...

For as long as I could remember Akiho has always been there. To me, her and Misa-nee were almost like siblings, maybe even family. I couldn't possibly imagine my life without them.

And yet... or perhaps, *because* of this. An odd sense of anxiety began to grow inside of me. And the more it thrived, the more it strengthened my worries. Eventually invading my mind, it placed a heavy burden on my soul.

After all...

Moving forward from this day drastic changes were bound to happen. Some of them we would experience both alike, while others entirely separate from each other.

Our victory just now was public knowledge, ending the days when people were belittling the Robotics Club. In fact, just now—before I escaped the crowd—I received a lot of requests from total strangers. All interested, all asking if they could join. I was fairly certain we were about to witness an absolute run on the club.

Misa-nee would undoubtedly be judged guilty by the mass-media. What's more... the chaos that happened at the Expo Arena in Odaiba and this final battle to prevent the launch of Black-1. We were directly involved in both of those events, presumably having to testify on the cases soon enough.

And probably most of all: We were right before graduation. By pursuing our future career paths we would likely end up leaving for different mainland universities. Of course, one of us might also join the working force right away. Eventually remaining on Tanegashima's grounds, leaving an endless ocean in-between—and inevitably separating the two of us all the more.

Amongst all of that, would we really take our relationship anywhere? Even thinking about my own feelings... Without knowing what the future held in store I felt reluctant to blindly pursue them. Both, for mine and for Akiho's sake.

&nbsp;

Right then—a series of loud beeping sounds brought me back to reality. Resounding throughout the entire hangar, they put an end to the illusion the two of us have been caught up in.

<span class="text-quoted-inline">“Oh, sorry... that's mine..."</span>, Akiho excused herself, pulling up her PokeCom. She then began to read something, probably a text message.

As she looked up again, her face took on a regretful expression.

<div class="text-quoted">“What's up?”</div>

<div class="text-quoted">“Mitchie texted me... The ambulance arrived. It's waiting on the runway, and the driver asked where we brought her.”</div>

Even though she spoke with a firm voice, Akiho's face began to turn pale. She seemed reluctant to let go of Misa-nee. After staying on her sister's side for all that time it must indeed be hard to leave...

<div class="text-quoted">“Aki-chan... It's fine. Just let me talk to them.”</div>

I tried to give her a chance to remain with Misa-nee for a little while longer. However—

<div class="text-quoted">“Kai...”</div>

Her eyes carried a gloomy look as she spoke, and her voice seemed to be on the verge of vanishing.

<div class="text-quoted">“...that's impossible.”</div>

As that faint whisper reached my ears, I realized her gaze was directed downwards—resting somewhere on the bleak concrete behind Misa-nee's body.

<div class="text-quoted">“...impossible? Why?”</div>

I realized there must be something else that she hasn't told me yet. Staring into her eyes, I sent out a questioning glance.

<div class="text-quoted">“There isn't just an ambulance. They... they also sent a police car.”</div>

I gulped. So we were right, after all... 

<div class="text-quoted">“I've been told to come out myself, too. In person.”</div>

After all, she was a direct relative of Misa-nee. Of all people out there, the two of us were were probably most relevant for their investigations. I had absolutely no doubt that I would be interviewed soon enough as well.

Hesitantly, Akiho loosened the fingers surrounding Misa-nee's hand.

<div class="text-quoted">“Big Sis... I'll visit. I'll visit as often as I can, as soon as possible...”</div>

A teardrop left her right eye as she rose to her feet.

<div class="text-quoted">“Kai... please, take good care of her...”</div>

And with this, Akiho disappeared from my sight. I was left behind in silence. Only the faint breathing sounds of Misa-nee's body filled the vast space of this hangar.

As I just sat there, Akiho no longer around, I took a closer look on her pilot suit. Her helmet got damaged and tossed away during the battle which left only that thin armour of hers to protect her body. The shoulders were entirely exposed, revealing her naked skin. Rather than a suit intended for combat, it felt like a suit intended for PR work.

Inspecting her arms I spotted something odd. A single white leaf, stuck in the slit between her black leather gloves' opening and the skin beneath. It appeared to be from a carnation flower, like the ones growing in front of the cliff at...

I froze.

Cold shivers went down my spine. Even now, the memory was still present. Vivid, as if it happened mere seconds ago.

<div class="text-quoted">“Misa-nee. There is something... I need to tell you. A message by a dear friend of yours.”</div>

<!-- <div class="story-image"><img src="images/EV_IRE005B.PNG"></div> -->

The pain-filled eyes, that forced smile. And that moment, as 'she' ultimately succumbed. Will broken, resistance beaten. Eventually giving herself away to 'her' fate.

<div class="text-quoted">“Thank you... for the HUG.”</div>

With this, I was finally fulfilling her last request.

<div class="text-quoted">“It's thanks to this, that I was able to live a pretty normal life. For these last two years... ever since the accident.” </div>

Mizuka-san's last words—eventually, they've found their way. Arriving at a person that should never be able to meet her again.

Upon hearing them...

Misa-nee remained silent. Her breathing unchanged, her face still blank. And perhaps that was exactly why... I felt, that Mizuka-san's message must have reached her.

Quoting Mizuka-san got me thinking. About ten years ago... And about who Misa-nee used to be.

To me, she was that unbeatable wall I sought to overcome. A brutal opponent I challenged over and over again. The rival that should ultimately define my own self, and my own ambitions.

To Akiho however—she must have been an idol. That absurd love for robots and the childlike chase for her dreams. All of it rubbed off on her, shaping the personality I knew all too well.

That's why... certainly, Misa-nee was a weird girl. Back when we were kids, we might have been fine with it. However, the people at her age, the people in her class... Besides the two of us, just how many friends did she actually have?

Before the Robotics Club came into existence, before Mizuka-san and Mitchie became part of her life—I couldn't recall any. She started off all by herself, enduring mockery and ridicule ever since. Up until this point, just what kind of person have you been, Misa-nee?

<div class="story-image"><img src="images/EV_MIS006A.PNG"></div>

<div class="text-italic-quoted text-lessmargintop">“...even the people I met.”</div>

Lost in thoughts, I murmured her strange words from just now...

<div class="text-italic-quoted">“Have they been written into my life...? Or were they truly meant for me...?”</div>

It happened around that time. The days and weeks before the Robotics Club was born—right before Misa-nee entered High School.

Whenever I visited Akiho's place, whenever I hang out with her. I felt like the days when Misa-nee was missing gradually increased. Each time we asked—she would just smile wistfully, a distant look in her eyes.

Where she went, whom she visited and why she did so—she never revealed any of it. In the end, whatever it was... remained in the dark, shrouded in mystery.

<div class="story-image"><img src="images/kouhouse.png"></div>

It wasn't before seven full years passed that I should learn about her relation to Kimijima Kou. The mastermind behind the <span id="hdproject" class="text-glossary">Human Domestication Project</span>—an inhuman attempt at reducing the world population to one billion people.

<div class="text-italic-quoted">“Sometimes... ignorance is bliss...”</div>

Even Mizuka-san... the person closest to Misa-nee. Did she ever know? Has Misa-nee ever told her?

I wasn't sure if I ever questioned it myself. Just what happened when Misa-nee wasn't around... After all, did I even care?

A decade ago, being a mere child—I foolishly believed whatever I felt like. Whether she spent her time with classmates, her friends or anyone else... It didn't matter.

Today, however... with the puzzle of Misa-nee's past right in front of me. Even with most of it assembled, even with its image almost obvious—even so, I felt the most important parts were still missing.

<div class="text-italic-quoted">“...the day of the solar eclipse. When it all began...”</div>

Back then... one of those parts, whichever it was. It must have changed her. Irrevocably shaping another person. Ultimately causing hopes to flourish, and dreams to rise.

That's why...

<div class="text-italic-bold">Some day.</div>

<div class="text-italic-bold">Would I ever find it?<br>
Would I ever understand?</div>
